Pomodoro technique advocated in 25 minutes time to focus on high quality work, then rest for 5 minutes.When the bell rang, it can be in "pending" today to draw a "X" from the form, and then quickly into a state of relaxation.In the rest time to completely empty brain, don't read email, read news, make a phone call, don't do it for the next pomodoro cause anything extra pressure.
